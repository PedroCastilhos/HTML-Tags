The `title` attribute specifies extra information about an element. The information is most often shown as a tooltip text when the mouse moves over the element.

```
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/" title="Go to W3Schools HTML section">Visit our HTML Tutorial</a>
```

<hr>

Use `mailto:` inside the `href` attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program (to let them send a new email):

```
<a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Send email</a>
```
